## 🎯 SIMPLE 5-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: Prepare Your Files (2 minutes)

On your computer, create this structure:

```
my-portfolio/
├── index.html                              (rename index_improved.html)
└── projects/
    └── alkaline-electrolyzer.html          (rename project-alkaline-electrolyzer.html)
```

**How to do it:**
1. Create a folder called `my-portfolio`
2. Rename `index_improved.html` → `index.html`
3. Create a folder inside called `projects`
4. Move `project-alkaline-electrolyzer.html` into `projects/` folder
5. Rename it to `alkaline-electrolyzer.html`

### STEP 2: Update the Links (3 minutes)

**In index.html**, find the Alkaline Electrolyzer project and add this button:

```html
<div class="btn-group" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <a href="projects/alkaline-electrolyzer.html" class="btn btn-primary">
        <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> View Details
    </a>
</div>
```

**In projects/alkaline-electrolyzer.html**, find the navigation link and change:
- `index_improved.html` → `../index.html` (everywhere it appears)

### STEP 3: Test Locally (1 minute)

## 📋 PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

Before uploading, verify:

- [ ] `index.html` is renamed (not `index_improved.html`)
- [ ] Project file is in `projects/` folder
- [ ] Links in index.html point to `projects/alkaline-electrolyzer.html`
- [ ] Links in project page point to `../index.html`

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** Project page shows 404 error
**Fix:** Check the file is in `projects/` folder and link is `projects/alkaline-electrolyzer.html`

**Problem:** Back button doesn't work
**Fix:** In project page, links should be `../index.html` (with two dots)

**Problem:** Icons don't show
**Fix:** Make sure Font Awesome CDN link is in `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css">
```

**Problem:** GitHub Pages shows README
**Fix:** Your main file must be named `index.html` (lowercase, in root folder)

**Problem:** Changes don't appear on live site
**Fix:** Wait 1-2 minutes, then hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
